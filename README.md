# Notifier_bot
## My telegram bot using python-telegram-bot and APScheduler library.
### Usage is simple - create a new notification using /notify TEXT#TIME where time is numeric value (minutes)
### Every user can use only one notification running at one time.
### To stop notification type /stop
### Bot is currently deployed on heroku and working - @zauvedomlyal_bot but due to free heroku plan is constantly falling asleep :) (might deploy it soon on AWS)
